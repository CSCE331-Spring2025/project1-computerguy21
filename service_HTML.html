          <p>
            Volunteered to become a notetaker for the people who have
            learning-based accommodations and needed other forms of recorded
            lecture content to learn from the class. I take pride in the level
            of detail of notes because it not only demonstrates my understanding
            of the material, but it also helps other people understand the
            material in a clear and concise way while providing a high level of
            visual detail.

            Collaborated with a team of Volunteers to organize food based on
            their expirations, as well as food types. Additionally, I assisted
            in giving out food during the pandemic to people in need of food.
