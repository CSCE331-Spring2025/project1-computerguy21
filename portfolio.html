          <p>
            One of the projects that has been on my waitlist as of recently. I
            originally developed a single-cycle MIPS processor for my computer
            architecture class as one of the class projects. I am looking
            forward to building upon this single-cycle processor and develop a
            more modern version of it, especially with the knowledge that I will
            be gaining from my Advanced Computer Architecture class.

          <h2>Monopoly Simulator</h2>
          <h3>Self-completed - date</h3>
          <p>
            This is one of the projects that I've been most proud of. This was
            develop to expedite the process of my AP environmental science
            project that required me to play a game of Monopoly with set rules
            and see how the number of players affected environmental resources.
            I took upon the challenge and developed a simulation that would take
            a couple of seconds to produce an output that would otherwise take
            hours of tedious playing and recording results. This project was
            develop in Java in a minimalistic IDE to test my computer science
            knowledge by using Queues, Stacks, and Object Oriented Programming
            (OOP) such as interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance.
