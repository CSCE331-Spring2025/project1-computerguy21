          <h2>MIPS Processor (single-cycle)</h2>
          <h3>Texas A&M University - date</h3>
          <p>
            One of the projects that has been on my waitlist as of recently. I
            originally developed a single-cycle MIPS processor for my computer
            architecture class as one of the class projects. The single-cycle processor included
            a program counter, controller, 32-bit register file, sign-extender, ALU, and data/instruction memory
            the data and instruction memories are separated for the time being as a band-aid fix for structural hazards
            when I start implementing a pipeline to the processor.
            I am looking forward to building upon this single-cycle processor and develop a
            more modern version of it. These modifications include pipelining, as mentioned earlier, and a
            basic implementation of a 2-bit branch predictor. With the knowledge I will
            be gaining from my Advanced Computer Architecture class, I will be implementing
            a Superscalar processor to further improve throughput through instruction parallelism and implement a basic cache design.
            Future problems that I may have to tackle when implementing these include data and control (branching) dependencies and will
            think of a solution to solve for these problems. The skills I will be gaining from this endeavor definitely includes enhancing
            my verilog debugging skills and learn to use other tools suhc as surf, a gtkwave alternative with more beautiful graphics.

          <h2>Monopoly Simulator</h2>
          <h3>Self-completed - date</h3>
          <p>
            This is one of the projects that I've been most proud of. This was
            develop to expedite the process of my environmental science
            project that required me to play a game of Monopoly with set rules
            and see how the number of players affected environmental resources.
            I took upon the challenge and developed a simulation that would take
            a couple of seconds to produce an output that would otherwise take
            hours of tedious playing and recording results. This project was
            developed in Java in a minimalistic IDE to test my computer science
            knowledge by translating the original game's object traits and organized them into 
            1 interface, 8 object classes, and 4 data structures such as arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists.
            The game output was put into a file thorugh BufferedWriter and was used to extrapolate future behavior and
            predict outcomes when the number of players changes.
