          One of the projects that has been on my waitlist as of recently. I
          originally developed a single-cycle MIPS processor for my computer
          architecture class as one of the class projects. I am looking forward
          to building upon this single-cycle processor and develop a more modern
          version of it, especially with the knowledge that I will be gaining
          from my Advanced Computer Architecture class.

          This is one of the projects that I've been most proud of. This was
          develop to expedite the process of my AP environmental science project
          that required me to play a game of Monopoly with set rules and see how
          the number of players affected environmental resources. I took upon
          the challenge and developed a simulation that would take a couple of
          seconds to produce an output that would otherwise take hours of
          tedious playing and recording results. This project was develop in
          Java in a minimalistic IDE to test my computer science knowledge by
          using Queues, Stacks, and Object Oriented Programming (OOP) such as
          interfaces, abstract classes, and inheritance.
